## FEATURES

- Has cool naruto symbols on it
- Lights up like any lamp
- Looks like a fishbowl and can probably hold fish
- nice glossy finish

## implementation

![implementation-sketch](./IMGS/implementation.jpeg)

I'm going to stick the cable up the lamp into the light socket.

## symbolism

using surface level analysis of naruto series i metaphorically extruded the HLV symbol while dug the uchiha crest symbol into lamp (itachi worked in the shadows for the village -> indented vs extuded).
